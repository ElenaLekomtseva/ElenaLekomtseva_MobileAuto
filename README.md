## Exercise 3
[Project branch hw3](https://github.com/ElenaLekomtseva/ElenaLekomtseva_MobileAuto/tree/hw3)

1. Suggest improvements for .properties reading. What are the purposes?
For different devices we need to change .property. It will be better if we configure the settings for each type of device. And the capability settings add to enum.
2. I added check for native and web tests. For web tests can also add a check result state code.
