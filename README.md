## Exercise 3
[Project branch hw3](https://github.com/ElenaLekomtseva/ElenaLekomtseva_MobileAuto/tree/hw3)

1. Suggest improvements for .properties reading. What are the purposes?
For different devices we need to change .property. It will be better if we configure the settings for each type of device.
2. I added check for native and web tests. For web tests I want check result state code, but didn't find method.
